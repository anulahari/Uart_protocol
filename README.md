# Uart_protocol
This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) communication protocol in Verilog HDL and is verified through both simulation and hardware testing on the DE10-Standard Cyclone V FPGA Kit.

The design uses 16 clock cycles per bit for precise baud rate generation and reliable data transmission. Both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) modules are built using an FSM (Finite State Machine) approach, ensuring accuracy and stability in communication.
